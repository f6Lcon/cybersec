## üß† Tips

- üîç **401 vs 403**:  
  - `401` = Not authenticated  
  - `403` = Authenticated, but not allowed  

- üìÅ **404 Enumeration**:  
  Use 404 patterns to guess directories or files.

- üì§ **3xx Responses**:  
  Good indicator of redirects ‚Äî watch for phishing or alternate login flows.

- üêû **5xx Responses**:  
  May expose stack traces, error logs, or other unintended debug info.
