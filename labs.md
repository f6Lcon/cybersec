# 🎯 Hack The Box Red Team Labs Tracker

Welcome to my Hack The Box (HTB) Red Team Labs documentation. This markdown file helps me track my red teaming progress, take notes, and reflect on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) learned from each lab. HTB Red Team labs are structured in progressive levels, simulating realistic adversary scenarios and blue team defenses.

## 🧠 Lab Format

- 💻 **Realistic Enterprise Environments**
- 📡 **Active Directory**, **SOC Detection**, **EDR/AV**
- 🚩 **Objective-Based** (e.g., domain admin, persistence, data exfil)
- 📂 **Great for practicing MITRE ATT&CK Techniques**
